- add muti bindings, like bind-event and bind-attr
- fix bug where if the user uses a "&" or a "|" in there expression it will only bind to the first value ie. "array1.length > 0 && array2.length > 0" it will only bind to array1
- fix bug with arrays, if you call array.push it dose not add an element to the array because its using a copy of the array
- improve expression.run
- add comment bindings
- make sure bindings aren't run twice when binding
