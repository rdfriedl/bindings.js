- test _eval with values as context
- add muti bindings, like bind-event and bind-attr
- create classes for binding types
- rebuild binding class so its easier to use and can be extended
- going to have to build contexts for all eval functions so you can do, "this.$parent" or "$parent.something" or "$parent.$parent"
